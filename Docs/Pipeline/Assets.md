# Pipeline: Making assets and sounds

Part of the pipeline notes (index: `Docs/Pipeline.md`). Rules: `CLAUDE.md`.

## Making an asset

1. The art session scripts the model in Blender (`Art/Models/<Category>/<File>.py`), with shared material names and texture sets from
   `Art/Textures/<Set>`.
2. It export-tests: `Tools\artrun.ps1` or `Tools\models.ps1 -NoImport -Out Intermediate\ArtExport_<Family>`.
3. Main stages only the new models (`Tools\stage_import.ps1 <folder> <names>`), runs `Looter.ImportModels <folder>_Import`, checks the
   import log (bounds, sockets, collision), and commits the `.py` with the `.uasset`s.
4. A colour-only change in the manifest can be set on the MI directly instead of reimporting a skeletal mesh (the lantern glow).
5. Tools: `Tools\artrun.ps1` runs a model script (`-Preview` renders it), any Blender script, or an export test, at below-normal
   priority, waiting while `Saved\ArtPause.flag` exists. `Tools/Blender/tangentcheck.py` checks an exported FBX's tangents as
   Unreal's import will; with `--log` it sorts the editor log's tangent warnings into the model's own and Unreal's reduced builds'.
6. Materials: the textured masters (`M_World`, `M_Gun` with per-gun wear, `M_WorldFoliage`, `M_Terrain`, `M_Water`) are built by
   `Tools/Unreal/build_world_materials.py`. Older surfaces use the flat stylized materials (`M_StylizedSurface`,
   `M_StylizedFoliage`, `M_StylizedGlow`).
   - The ground's layers (2026-10-12, `M_Terrain`): under the macro map's colour sit three detail layers and damp soil. The macro map
     picks them: grass on green ground; matted thatch (`GroundThatch`) on gold and dry ground; stony ground (`GroundStony`: crust,
     gravel, stones, and leaf litter under trees) on bare soil, roads and scree; darker, glossier damp soil in the hollows (the
     terrain's baked occlusion). Each layer is normalized by its own mean (`T_<Set>_stats.json`, written with the textures), so a
     texture change moves the pattern, never the ground's colour from afar.
   - Textures come from `Tools/Blender/looter_textures.py` (sets `GroundThatch`, `GroundStony`, `GroundNoise`; the thatch's height and
     the stony ground's leaf litter ride in the colour map's alpha). The master is rebuilt by `build_world_materials.py M_Terrain`;
     its numbers are `GROUND_DEFAULTS` (repeats, how far the borders wander, the damp, where the contrast fades out), and an area's
     instance may change any of them.
   - Judge a change without Unreal first: `Tools\artrun.ps1 -Script Tools\Blender\ground_preview.py` renders the layers from tour
     viewpoints at eye height (before above, after below) into `Saved/ArtPreviews/Terrain/`. It is a numpy port of the master's code:
     keep it in step with `GROUND_WEIGHTS` and `GROUND_DEFAULTS`. It has no shadows, grass or hollows' damp, so look in the editor too.
7. Guns from parts: `Art/Models/Weapons/<Gun>.py` models the parts (sockets chain them; sights carry `SOCKET_Aim` for aiming down
   sights). `<Gun>.parts.csv` lists each part's key, name, name word, rarity and stat ranges in percent (capped per stat,
   `Weapons/WeaponParts.h`). After importing, run `Tools/Unreal/setup_gun_parts.py` in the editor to fill the gun's definition from
   the spreadsheet.
   - The Drover (2026-10-09), the third family (Bullpup rifle, Ranchhand shotgun, Drover revolver on pistol ammo):
     `Art/Models/Weapons/Drover.py` and `Drover.parts.csv`; parts by key as the others (frame, barrel, cylinder, sight, grip; never
     rename or reuse a key).
   - A new kind needs the C++ first (`EWeaponKind::Revolver`, `EWeaponReloadPart::Cylinder`), then in the editor, in this order:
     `create_revolver.py` (makes `DA_Revolver`, puts it in the default loot table), `setup_gun_parts.py` (the parts from the CSV),
     `create_rank_assets.py` (so the ranks' loot tables take the new gun).
   - The Drover's cylinder swings out on SOCKET_Crane; its chambers are the CSV's Magazine for that cylinder (rarity never changes
     the count). A short gun is held out by its definition's `HoldReach`.
8. Throwables: `Art/Models/Throwables/<Name>.py` (the grave-salt grenade, `SaltGrenade.py`) becomes `/Game/Art/Throwables/SM_<Name>`
   through `Tools\models.ps1 -Only <Name>`. Code loads it by path (`AGraveSaltGrenade`, `AGrenadePickup`), and a path is not a
   reference: `/Game/Art/Throwables` is listed under `DirectoriesToAlwaysCook` in `Config/DefaultGame.ini`, so a packaged game has
   it. A new category folder needs the same line.

Rules that saved time:
- Exports must be repeatable. Never iterate BMesh sets (their order changes between runs). Export twice and compare; only FBX IDs
  and time stamps may differ.
- Faces without UV area give tangent warnings; `Tools/Blender/tangentcheck.py` predicts them.
- Terrain meshes keep 100% Nanite fallback. Medium draws the fallback and collision is cooked from it.
- A variant of a model (Farmhouse_Ransom) goes in the same script, with the original exported byte-identical.
- A prop whose pieces the game hides is several models on one pivot in the same script (the porch plate: plate, jars,
  biscuits).
- The kit's `_triangulate` collapses triangles under 1 mm^2: build tiny details (ink, cards) as single faces of at least
  1 mm^2 a triangle. Map round, flat parts with `Tile(set, along=None)` (the default turns each face's grain to its long side:
  a star of seams on a lathe's floor).
- Tangent warnings logged by a reimport's first build come from Unreal's default fallback, not the model
  (SM_RR_RangerCabin, 2026-10-13); `tangentcheck --log` labels them.

## Sounds (script-made, 2026-10-08)

- The user's rule: sounds are synthesized from scratch, like the scripted models: no recordings, libraries, AI generators or new
  programs. Blender 4.4's bundled Python has numpy (no system Python on this PC).
- Exception (the user, 2026-10-21): royalty-free recordings for **guns and bullet impacts only**, always processed through the
  recipes. Source: Sonniss GDC bundles 2016/2017 (games OK, edits OK, no attribution; no resale/redistribution as sounds, no AI
  training). Raw packs in `Saved/SoundPacks/Sonniss` (outside git); the excerpts used in `Art/Sounds/packs/Sonniss/` (LFS, cut
  by `packs/make_pack.py`; sources and licence in `packs/README.md`). Never publish `packs/`.
- Make: `Art/Sounds/lib` (synthesis library), `Art/Sounds/recipes/<group>.py` (one recipe per cue, seeded takes). `Tools\sounds.ps1
  [cue patterns]` renders `Art/Sounds/Out/<Cue>_NN.wav` and `cues.json` (each cue's mix) and runs `check.py` (peaks, DC, clicks, loop
  seams, harsh bands; spectrograms and a listening page in `Saved/SoundCheck/`). Agents can't hear: they judge by numbers and
  pictures; the user listens.
- Into the game: `Tools\console.ps1 "py C:/Dev/AI_Looter_Shooter/Tools/Unreal/build_sound_bank.py [check]"` imports the WAVs to
  `/Game/Audio`, makes the classes (under `SC_Master`), the mix and attenuations, and fills `DA_SoundBank`.
- In code: `LooterSound::PlayAt/PlayAttached/Play2D/Start/Stop` by cue name (`Audio/LooterSoundCues.h`). A cue without sounds plays
  nothing, so code can call new cues first. Add a cue to the header and to `cues.json` together.
- Groups (each a recipe file listed in `recipes/__init__.py`'s `GROUPS`; an unlisted file is never rendered). Cue name namespaces:
  `LooterSoundCue::Lootables`, `::Throwable`, `::Voice`, `::TownLife`, `::Revolver`, `::Economy`, `::BellRinger`, `::Shrine`,
  `::Spitter`; `WeaponSounds.h` picks a gun's cues by its kind.
  - 2026-10-09: `props` (the lootable world), `throwables` (the grave-salt grenade), `voices` (the Unpaid's murmured barks, one
    syllable a cue; the spiders' and slimes' idle calls; the living heard through walls on Ransom's Rest). The Drover's shots and
    reload steps are in `guns`, the fast-travel whoosh in `ui`.
  - 2026-10-12: `economy` (silver found, 2D and the player's own: `Loot.Silver.Pickup`; vendor: `Vendor.Buy`, `Vendor.Sell`,
    `Vendor.NotEnough`), `bells` (the Bell-Ringer's bronze hand bell), `shrines` (the Vigil Stones; the iron bell is `bells.py`'s hand
    bell made duller, so `shrines.py` imports from it). The Venom Spitter's cues are in `creatures`. The pickup chime keeps the
    2-5 kHz band cut, since a fight's worth of pickups sounds it over and over.
  - 2026-10-13 (69 cues): `givers`, `graves` (a grave marked as the save point), `holds` (the hold ring's completion, kept in the
    frequent-cue 2-5 kHz check), `lostloot`, `missions`, `orelift`, `watchfire`, `miners` (the dead miners; Hiram's and Thaddeus's
    sounds), `foreman`. Stamps on the cards land 0.11 s in, on the cards' slam.
  - 2026-10-14 (334 cues in all): `animals` (`::Animals`), `gusts` (`::Gust`), `windows` (`::Window`), `reactions`
    (`::React`: notice, emerge, twitch, bubble, swell, ash), `brass` (`::Casing` by surface, `::FlyBy` whiz and venom hiss);
    `player` adds `Player.Land.Hard`, `Player.Splash` (`::Footfall`).
  - Lessons (`Art/Sounds/README.md`): start soft cues on a small physical touch (the check flags a late start); put a loop's seam in a
    lull between events; mix loop layers by loudness, not peak. CLICK compares spikes with the local level 30 dB under the
    cue's peak: a crackle thinning to a few grains a second flags in its tail (keep its rate floor high: Spitter Sizzle 1500/s).
- For the user: the listening page is an Artifact with the WAVs as its files (<https://claude.ai/artifact/VDmyrPmAsxiNa6boNuqKxa>);
  republish it from the session's scratchpad copy after a render.
- Lesson: setting a USoundClass's `child_classes` all at once parents only the first new child; add them one at a time
  (`build_sound_bank.py` does).
